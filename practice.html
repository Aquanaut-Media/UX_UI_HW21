  <br>
  <p>One of the first concerns most people have with practicing is how often to practice and when to do it. My recommendation is always simple; Practice as often as you can! Granted, sometimes even the most hardcore musicians have days that feel uninspired, but I generally say that to progress at a comfortable pace you should get at least one or two good sessions in a week. I’m also a firm believer in that there are two kinds of people: those who run on schedules, and those who don’t. This is obviously oversimplified, but in general, music is a passion. Some people prefer to schedule their lives and passions out, and if this is you, then treat your practicing this way. Find a good time in your schedule and pencil in as much practicing as you feel like you want to get done. But if you’re the more spontaneous type, I recommend picking up your instrument whenever inspiration strikes, whether at lunch time or 2AM. Thank goodness for headphones!</p>

  <p>At first take, practicing seems so simple. You just sit down, plug in your bass and play, right? In a sense, yes. Obviously, practicing most of the time will involve sitting down and playing. But when? How often and for how long? And then, the question becomes what to practice. Should you practice playing with a metronome or learn scales and riffs? Navigating this maze of ideas as a newcomer to music can unexpectedly become a daunting task. It can also be dangerous; feeling unsure of your practice routine can quickly turn into feeling like doing anything but practicing. But fear not, help is here. To avoid this practicing pitfall and help you develop a consistent, productive, and enjoyable practice routine, I’ve laid out my favorite top 10 tips to practicing your bass guitar.</p>

  <h3 class="hero-heading"> 2. Get Organized</h3>
  <br>
  <p>My next piece of advice is one that often gets overlooked: organization. While not all organizational strategies will work for everyone, taking some basic steps to ensure stress-free practice sessions is a must. Obviously, have your practicing area and equipment clean and ready for use (more on that in tip #3). I recommend having any written materials you’re working on printed or written out. iPads are great, but can be seriously unreliable making pencils king in the practice room. If you’re working on a variety of things at once, keep your pages separate. Nothing disrupts your flow like having to stop and dig through messy papers to find that one example you need. Accordion folders and binder dividers both work equally well here. Computers are invaluable tools for music, but when it comes to practicing materials or song ideas I always prefer a hard copy.</p>

  <h3 class="hero-heading">3. Have the tools you need.</h3>
  <br>
  <p>This tip can be a bit more finance-dependent than the others, but excellent tools for  practicing and writing are available to those on any budget. You'll need a bass, a guitar cable and some sort of amplifier, large or small. I’d also invest in a simple music stand. Another absolute essential is a metronome. Don’t bother with a dedicated unit if you have a smartphone as there are a variety of excellent metronome apps (many 100% free) for both iPhone and Android. These will work great for almost any practicing need.</p>
  <p> 
    Another excellent investment - albeit a bit larger - is a simple computer recording setup. While this can be a bit more money, it’s often not nearly as expensive or difficult to set up as you might think. It is also an incredible practice tool, as you can record yourself practicing and hear your progress afterwards. Unless your computer is 10+ years old, you can easily get into simple recording for a few hundred dollars or less. All you need is a basic audio interface, speakers and recording software. A decent setup may run around $200 but you can get away with a lot less should the need arise. Head to your local music shop and ask them; If they can’t help you get the right equipment, they’ll know who can.</p>
