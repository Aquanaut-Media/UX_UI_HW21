    <h4>Three Tricks to Master Your Bass Fretboard</h4>
        <p> If you want to learn your bass fretboard and really master it, it can take a while.  Not all of us have the time to sit alone in our living room or bedroom for hours learning every little detail and intricacy of our fretboard. But you still need to be able to get by. If you’re playing with someone and they start calling notes out to you, you’ll need to know how to find the notes on your fretboard in a hurry.

        <p>Thankfully, there are three methods of learning your bass fretboard that don’t take a lot of time, but still give you the freedom and confidence to play all over your bass.The first is a counterintuitive truth that makes the process of learning the notes far easier. The second will literally cut your learning time in half, and the third will multiply the notes you already know.</p>
        
        <p>Remember though, these ‘tricks’ and ‘hacks’ to learn your fretboard are great to get you started. But they can only take you so far. They won't give you a deep understanding of your bass. Most people get tripped up somewhere, and for bass players learning the notes on the fretboard, it’s usually when they start to look at sharps and flats. It can get confusing when you realize that some notes are called more than one thing.</p>
        
        <p></p>So if you’re still confused or just that deeper understanding of your fretboard, check out my Ultimate Guide To Learning Your Bass Fretboard. In it, you’ll learn all about the ‘Musical Matrix’, which will clear up any confusion you have about the sharps and flats.</p>

            <p>Get yourself a Bass Fretboard Instructional Poster. This is a great learning tool for beginning and intermediate bass players. The 11" x 17" instructional guide is nice to hang on the wall wherever you practice for easy reference, instead of flipping through a book. This chart includes the notes of the bass displayed on the fretboard. The chart also includes the Nashville Numbering Chart and Circle of Fifths. This information can be found in books, but rarely on one easy to read chart!</p>
